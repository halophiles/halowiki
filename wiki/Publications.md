Background Haloferax volcanii is an easily culturable moderate halophile that grows on simple defined media, is readily transformable, and has a relatively stable genome. This, in combination with its biochemical and genetic tractability, has made Hfx. volcanii a key model organism, not only for the study of halophilicity, but also for archaeal biology in general.  Methodology/Principal Findings We report here the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Hfx. volcanii DS2, the type strain of this species. The genome contains a main 2.848 Mb chromosome, three smaller chromosomes pHV1, 3, 4 (85, 438, 636 kb, respectively) and the pHV2 plasmid (6.4 kb).  Conclusions/Significance The completed genome sequence, presented here, provides an invaluable tool for further in vivo and in vitro studies of Hfx. volcanii.

Since most archaea are extremophilic and difficult to cultivate, our current knowledge of their biology is confined largely to comparative genomics and biochemistry. Haloferax volcanii offers great promise as a model organism for archaeal genetics, but until now there has been a lack of a wide variety of selectable markers for this organism. We describe here isolation of H. volcanii leuB and trpA genes encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase and tryptophan synthase, respectively, and development of these genes as a positive selection system. ΔleuB and ΔtrpA mutants were constructed in a variety of genetic backgrounds and were shown to be auxotrophic for leucine and tryptophan, respectively. We constructed both integrative and replicative plasmids carrying the leuB or trpA gene under control of a constitutive promoter. The use of these selectable markers in deletion of the lhr gene of H. volcanii is described.

Two new Haloferax-Escherichia shuttle vectors are described, pMDS20 and pMLH3. These vectors contain the E. coli ColE1 plasmid ori region and ampicillin-resistance(ApR)-conferring bla gene, and the Haloferax pHK2 replicon region and novobiocin-resistance (NbR)-encoding gyrB gene, enabling maintenance and selection in both hosts. Plasmid pMLH3 has, in addition, a H. volcanii mevinolin-resistance (MvR) determinant and restriction sites allowing insertional inactivation of either marker, to facilitate the identification of Haloferax transformants harbouring cloned sequences. Sequencing of gyrA, within the NbR determinant, and the pHK2 ori region has been completed so the complete sequence of both pMDS20 and pMLH3 is now known.

N-Glycosylation is a post-translational modification common to all three domains of life. In many archaea, the oligosacharyltransferase (AglB)-dependent N-glycosylation of flagellins is required for flagella assembly. However, whether N-glycosylation is required for the assembly and/or function of the structurally related archaeal type IV pili is unknown. Here, we show that of six Haloferax volcanii adhesion pilins, PilA1 and PilA2, the most abundant pilins in pili of wild-type and ΔaglB strains, are modified under planktonic conditions in an AglB-dependent manner by the same pentasaccharide detected on H. volcanii flagellins. However, unlike wild-type cells, which have surfaces decorated with discrete pili and form a dispersed layer of cells on a plastic surface, ΔaglB cells have thick pili bundles and form microcolonies. Moreover, expressing PilA1, PilA2, or PilA6 in ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB stimulates microcolony formation compared with their expression in ΔpilA[1–6]. Conversely, expressing PilA3 or PilA4 in ΔpilA[1–6] cells results in strong surface adhesion, but not microcolony formation, and neither pilin stimulates surface adhesion in ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB cells. Although PilA4 assembles into pili in the ΔpilA[1–6]ΔaglB cells, these pili are, unlike wild-type pili, curled, perhaps rendering them non-functional. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a differential effect of glycosylation on pilus assembly and function of paralogous pilins. The growth of wild-type cells in low salt media, a condition that decreases AglB glycosylation, also stimulates microcolony formation and inhibits motility, supporting our hypothesis that N-glycosylation plays an important role in regulating the transition between planktonic to sessile cell states as a response to stress.
