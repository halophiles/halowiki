>Title
Crystal violet staining
>Introduction
This protocol describes staining of Haloferax volcanii cells with crystal violet.
The procedure can be used for petri dishes (bottom/side of dish), 12-well plates (cover slips), 96-well plates (bottom/side) with corresponding volumes.
>Literature

>Materials
18 % salt water (wash solution)
2 % (v/v) acetic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O or 2 % glutaraldehyde in 18 % salt water (fixing solution)
0.1 % (w/v in H<sub>2</sub>O) crystal violet (staining solution)
H2O (wash solution)

>Procedure
1. Remove excess culture
- decant excess culture from petri dish/plate, dab on paper towel
- coverslips are removed from the wells with forceps, excess liquid culture is removed by gently dabbing onto kimwipes
2. Gently wash 3x with 18 % salt water
- use 2 ml for small (60mm) petri dishes
- submerge cover slips in wash solution (e.g. well of a reused 12-well plate)
- fill well of 96-well plate with your corresponding culture volume + 50 ul
- **Caution**: pipette/wash gently, too harsh washing can remove attached cells!
3. Fix cells with 2 % acetic acid for 3 min or 2 % glutaraldehyde for 1 h
- use the same volumes as in the previous step
- again, pipette gently
4. Remove fixing solution
- air dry after fixing with acetic acid
- wash with water once after fixing with glutaraldehyde (samples can be stored in water or stained without compelte drying needed)
5. Stain cells with 0.1 % crystal violet for 10 min
6. Remove crystal violet and wash the plate/petri dish 3x with H2O
